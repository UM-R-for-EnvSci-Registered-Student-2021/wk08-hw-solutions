# Data loading

First we start by loading up all the data

```{r}

low_sites <- read_csv(here("data", "sites.csv"))
low_sample_log <- read_csv(here("data", "sample_log.csv"))
low_results_2002 <- read_csv(here("data", "results_2002.csv"))
low_results_2004 <- read_csv(here("data", "results_2004.csv"))

```

# Data binding and joining

With all the data loaded, we are going to start binding and joining the different oieces to get to our main, combined,dataset

Let's start by binding the two years of results data into one:

```{r bind results}

low_results <- bind_rows(low_results_2002, low_results_2004)

print(low_results)

```

Now that we have our complete hree pieces (sites, sample_log, and results), we want to join thse toguether. For that we will use the `left_join()` function starting by joining the sample log to the site info (using *monitoring_location_id* as our key column) followed by a left yoing with the results data (using *sample_id* as our key column)

```{r join datasets}

low_data <- low_sample_log %>% 
  left_join(low_sites, by = "monitoring_location_id") %>% 
  left_join(low_results, by = "sample_id")

print(low_data)

```
# Data processing

Now that we have one single, combine, dataset, we still need to do some processing. 

- First we will use `pivot_longer()` to change the parameter columns into long form.
- Second we will `mutat()` the year variable into a factor to ensure we can create our boxplots.

```{r process data}

low_data_long <- low_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(nitrate,nitrite,
                        ammonia,
                        total_nitrogen_mixed_forms,
                        soluble_reactive_phosphorus_srp,
                        total_phosphorus_mixed_forms),
               names_to = "parameter",
               values_to = "concentration") %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year, levels = c("2002", "2004"))) %>% 
  mutate(parameter = str_to_title(parameter)) %>% 
  mutate(parameter = case_when(
    parameter == "Total_nitrogen_mixed_forms" ~ "Total N",
    parameter == "Soluble_reactive_phosphorus_srp" ~ "SRP",
    parameter == "Total_phosphorus_mixed_forms" ~ "Total P",
    TRUE ~ parameter  # This line tells case_when() that any other case just gets whatever value parameter had already
  ))

print(low_data_long)

```

# Plots

With all the data ready to go, we just need to plot

```{r}

low_plot <- low_data_long %>% 
  ggplot() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(basin), cols = vars(parameter)) +
  # facet_wrap(~ parameter, nrow = 1) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = year, y = concentration, colour = year), fill = NA) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_pepe() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = expression(Concentration~(mu*g~.~L^{-1})),  # with expression() you can plot math. "~" means a space
       title = "Lake winnipeg nutrients",
       subtitle = "Water surface nutrient concentrations in the North and South basins for 2002 and 2004")

low_plot

```

Let's save it

```{r}

ggsave(here("figures", "low_plot.pdf"), low_plot, width = 190, height = 120, units = "mm")


```
